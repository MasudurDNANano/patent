## Abstract
To provide a system by which evaluation of circumstances of contamination by microparticles having nucleic acid can be performed rapidly and accurately. The theme is achieved by a system for measuring microparticles that includes: (1) a microparticle adhesion step of adhering the microparticles having nucleic acid to a microparticle adhesion member; (2) a membrane breakage step of breaking membranes of the adhered microparticles by electrical discharge; (3) an electrophoresis step of electrophoresing the microparticles in a thickness direction of a gel to make the nucleic acid in the microparticles migrate from a negative electrode side toward a positive electrode side and adhere the nucleic acid on a surface of a nucleic acid detection member; and (4) a nucleic acid measurement step of fluorescently staining the surface of the nucleic acid detection member to measure a concentration of the nucleic acid.

FIG. 1 is a process diagram for describing an embodiment in outline. In this process diagram, the microparticle adhesion member 22 and the nucleic acid detection member 23 are configured as different members. The microparticles 21 having nucleic acid 20 proceed through the steps according to the arrows from an upper left side of the figure, and by proceeding through the steps at an upper right side, a lower right side, and a lower left side, the nucleic acid 20 is measured.
First, in a microparticle adhesion step at the upper left, the microparticles 21 having nucleic acid are adhered to the surface of the microparticle adhesion member 22. The microparticle adhesion member 22, on which the microparticles 21 are thus adhered, proceeds to a subsequent membrane breakage step (upper right of the figure).
With the microparticles, with which the membranes have been broken, an electrophoresis step of using a gel 1 and electrophoresing in a thickness direction of the gel is then performed to make the nucleic acid 20 migrate from a negative electrode side toward a positive electrode side. The nucleic acid 20 thus migrates to a surface of a tape 2 of a nucleic acid detection member 23 (lower right of the figure).
Finally, the gel 1 on the nucleic acid detection member 23 is removed, the nucleic acid 20 adhered on the surface of the tape 2 is fluorescently stained, and a concentration of the nucleic acid 20 is measured (nucleic acid measuring step).
